# Emma's Coding Dojo Bootstrap Assignment

This is the repo for my mockup of a Bootstrap styled website for Coding Dojo's Web Fundamentals course.

Here you will find:
* The HTML file that opens in the browser fully styled
* In the HTML file there is the code necessary to link the bootstrap CSS style
* A jpeg of an image from George Méliès film, A Voyage to the Moon, that I was trying to incorporate as a background but couldn't make work. I kept it thinking maybe I'll try again later
* This README.md file
